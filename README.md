### 🔁 What You Should Update
- Replace `your-portfolio-live-link.com` with your Netlify link
- Add screenshot paths or upload images to GitHub `assets/screens/`
- Ensure project name matches your GitHub repo

Want me to generate the same README as a markdown file (`README.md`) so you can copy it directly to your repo?
